# Geospatial and seasonal variation of bronchiolitis in England
We sought to describe spatial variation (by region and clinical commissioning group, CCG) in the seasonality of hospital admissions for bronchiolitis and its association with local demographic characteristics. This Stata code prepares bronchiolitis hospital admission data, produces descriptive statistics and runs seasonality analyses.
# Data sources and access
1) English Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care (HES APC) records. NHS hospital episode statistics was provided within the terms of a data sharing agreement (NIC-393510-D6H1D-v3.2) to the researchers by NHS Digital. The data do not belong to the authors and may not be shared by the authors, except in aggregate form for publication. Data can be obtained by submitting a data request through the NHS Digital Data Access Request Service.<br/>
2) Index of multiple deprivation, by CCG. Freely available from the Ministry of Housing Communities & Local Government: https://gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015.<br/>
3) Annual CCG population size. Freely available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS): https://ons.gov.uk/releases/smallareapopulationestimatesinenglandandwalesmid2016. <br/>
4) The area of each CCG in square kilometres. Estimated using polygon areas in QGIS, an open source software, available: http://qgis.osgeo.org.<br/>
