# Geospatial and seasonal variation of bronchiolitis in England
We sought to describe spatial variation in the seasonality of hospital admissions for bronchiolitis and its association with local demographic characteristics. This Stata code prepares bronchiolitis hospital admission data, produces descriptive statistics and runs seasonality analyses.
# Data sources and access
1) English Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care (HES APC) records. NHS hospital episode statistics was provided within the terms of a data sharing agreement (NIC-393510-D6H1D-v3.2) to the researchers by NHS Digital. The data do not belong to the authors and may not be shared by the authors, except in aggregate form for publication. Data can be obtained by submitting a data request through the NHS Digital Data Access Request Service.<br/>
